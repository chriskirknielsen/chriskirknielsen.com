Over the years, I've build a few "generators" on CodePen that usually rely on randomness. Here are a few of my favourites:

## Noisy Risograph Gradient Celestial Body

A mouthful of a title but basically a grainy gradient that kinda looks like a planet, ish? Grainy gradients are a prominent thing with risograph printing, and since it's something I really enjoy to look at, I wanted to try my hand at creating that with code! In this pen, every click of the button will generate a new, random grainy gradient. This canvas-based one is my "official" version, but I also made a [pure SVG one](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/rNmgXyV) (which is less controllable), and a [Houdini (CSS Paint API) version](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/wveMqxv) but that has low browser support.

## Liam Neeson Movie Poster Generator

Liam Neeson is a gem. He's a great actor and has gravitas. He's also played in a lot of movies relatively recently that have a similar "vibe", following the "Taken" movie formula. As such, it got me thinking, could we predict his next movie using this generator?

I grabbed a bunch of images of him, created a bunch of fake titles and taglines (in two parts), and some results are very believable, while others are just plain hilarious (at least to me!). Have fun!

## Tycho Art Generator

Tycho is an electronic music artist who makes very soothing tracks. But another name is [ISO50](https://iso50.com/), the graphic designer side of Scott Hansen. He makes his own art for his album covers and tour posters, and you can distill some of that essence into a basic idea of a triangle and/or a circle with a few vibrant colour palettes. So I figured, why not create a generator that spits out Tycho art? It's nowhere near as sophisicated as the real thing, but once in a while, it comes pretty close!

Oh and pretty cool thing: Tycho himself retweeted my generator!
