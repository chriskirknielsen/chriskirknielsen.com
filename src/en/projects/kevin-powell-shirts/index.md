Kevin Powell, a brilliant CSS educator on YouTube needed to refresh his merchandise, and I was very happy to help! CSS is a subject that is very dear to me, and having the opportunity to work on designs on the topic was a lot of fun! Kevin wanted to celebrate CSS, with a retro feeling â€” to avoid monotone designs, I opted for a different style for each: neon, Swiss (ish?), and retrofuturism.
