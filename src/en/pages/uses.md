## Gear

-   [2019 16" MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/) (Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD)
    A good computer with a real Escape key, after all these years with a fake touchscreen one.
-   [Dell U2518D Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-LED-Lit-Monitor-U2518D-Compatibility/dp/B075KGLYRL?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    A big screen for big code.
-   [Autonomous AI ErgoChair 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair/?rid=7a4b2c) _(disclaimer: contains a referral ID, gives you a discount)_
    I think they recently renamed this to be ErgoChair Pro but it's a **good** chair.
-   [Fully's Remi Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/remi-standing-desk.html)
    I sit a lot, so having a desk that easily goes from sitting to standing is really helpful.
-   [ErGear Dual Monitor Arms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085Y4HW8S?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    Frees up some space on my desk with easily adjusted positions, good stuff.
-   [Sony MDR-XB50AP in-ear headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRXB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset/dp/B00JRD13T8?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    Simple, reliable earbuds for "casual" audio listening, and useful for video meetings.
-   [Sony MDR-XB950N1 over-ear headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Headphones-Bluetooth-Canceling/dp/B07KKMGG6H?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    Quality earphones for more "focused" listening, with noise-cancelling.
-   [Novation Launchkey 37 MIDI keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086N4W81X?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    I made music a lot in the past, and this little toy is great to slowly get back into it!

## Apps

-   [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    I've been using Firefox since version 3 or something, and it's never disappointed me â€” love the CSS DevTools!
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    Love how powerful and customisable this editor is! I notably use these extensions:
    -   [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode): A beautiful neon-infused theme.
    -   [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Keeps all my code harmoniously formatted.
    -   [VisuBezier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chriskirknielsen.visubezier): My own CSS easing function preview tool.
-   [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
    I love working with vectors! I optimise my work with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and then manually tweak them to be _just right_.
-   [Fork](https://fork.dev/)
    A little git GUI that helps me avoid making big mistakes.
-   [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)
    Beautiful tool to compress images better, you won't regret it.
