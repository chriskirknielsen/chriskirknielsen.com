## Colophon

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a fantastic static site generator. I [pre-compile](/blog/eleventy-asset-pipeline-precompiled-assets/) my Sass files to CSS, and minify my scripts. I then inline that to reduce HTTP requests, and this whole thing is hosted via [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Also used: [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com), [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac), [GlyphHanger](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger), [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)â€¦

The theme picker is more than a little inspired by [Max BÃ¶ck's own](https://mxb.dev), while the eclecticism is inspired by [Sophie Koonin's site](https://localghost.dev/). The synth on the [About page](/about/) is based on [Bret Cameron's tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-code-a-playable-synth-keyboard/), and extended with envelope shaping and lowpass filtering by peeking at [Daniel Schulz's code](https://iamschulz.com/building-a-synthesizer-in-javascript/).

    <ul class="u-marginBlockStart-s">
        <li><strong>Dusk:</strong> A neon-infused, retrowave-inspired theme which is basically my entire personality.</li>
        <li><strong>Dawn:</strong> This very-off-white theme aims to be a light-mode version of Dusk.</li>
        <li><strong>Vapor:</strong> A vaporwave interpretation of a theme which was a lot of fun to make, I'll thank Sophie Koonin here again for embracing this aesthetic!</li>
        <li><strong>Y2K:</strong> I grew up using Windows 98 and XP, so I kinda had to make this one. (I had lots of fun with the footer logo)</li>
        <li><strong>Neo-Tokyo:</strong> Retrowave is cool, but dystopian cyberpunk styles are cool too â€” a little Akira-flavoured!</li>
        <li><strong>Campfire:</strong> Opposite from the previous one, this takes heavy inspiration from the video game Firewatch and <a href="http://ollymoss.com/#/firewatch/">Olly Moss</a>'s beautiful artwork, and goes for a "national parks" vibe. (also, <a href="https://alistairshepherd.uk/">Alistair</a> did it better)</li>
