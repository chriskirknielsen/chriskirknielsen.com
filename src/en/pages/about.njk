    <p>
        As a kid, I spent hours on Microsoft Paint, until I discovered Photoshop (I had a <em>totally</em> valid licence). I learned some code to customise MySpace pages, and eventually made my own websites. I even paid for domains and hosting, and proclaimed myself <strong>"webmaster"</strong> before I even had zits — the hubris. After graduating, I <strong>studied graphic design</strong> for 4 years, then did some freelancing, juggling between design work, video editing, and code for a few years with neat clients, before focusing on <strong>web development.</strong>
    </p>

<p>
    Writing code and having a thing show up on the screen felt (and still feels) a little like <em class="about-emoji" data-emoji="✨">magic</em>. Currently, I work at MOJO PSG as a senior front-end dev with a wonderful team, striving to make <strong>accessible and performant</strong> web pages, and learning new things in this constantly evolving field.

{% include 'components/about/visubezier.njk' %}

<p data-about="opensource">
    I have contributed to a few open source projects, but only in small ways; if it counts, this little VS Code extension of mine called <a href="/projects/visubezier/">VisuBezier</a> to preview CSS timing functions is worth a look. And I've been lucky enough to be published on sites like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/chriskirknielsen/">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/chriskirknielsen/">Smashing Magazine</a>, if you can believe it!

<h2 id="still-creative-on-occasion">Still creative, on occasion</h2>

<p data-about="creative">
    When inspiration strikes, <strong>I like to create designs</strong> that might look good on a t-shirt — still getting those creative juices flowing! You can check all those out in the <a href="/designs/">Designs "Shop"</a> if you're interested; it's got lots of dev-related designs, and a few <em class="about-emoji" data-emoji="🌴">'80s aesthetics</em> (my favourite!). I also enjoy movies and play video games from time to time, so if you want to make my day, try a movie quote on me. You might want to know that <a href="/fonts/">I've created a few typefaces</a> — I consider myself a font nerd and will (try to) recognise the font used for every logo until my last breath.

    Surprise, I like music! I listen to a lot of things, however, my playlists are largely (post-)rock and electronica flavoured. <a href="https://chronoise.com">Chronoise</a> is a project for my mediocre musical musings that I haven't actively worked on in a while, but maybe in {{ metadata.currentYear + 1 }}. It's relaxing to play a little bit of guitar, and I find experimenting with <em>synthesisers incredibly fun</em>. <span class="nojs-hidden">Seriously, try it:</span>

<h2 id="french-dane-">French… Dane?</h2>

<p class="about-quotebox | standout" data-about="personal">My English accent is weird and kind of all over the place. But it's not French.</p>

<p>
    I grew up in Lyon, France, born to Danish parents. Australia was also my home for a year as a kid, speaking English with a Down Under accent, and I even held a baby koala. So if I blurt a word in French, sorry, <strong>three languages</strong> just keep blending in that bald head of mine. I do know a decent amount of Italian but lose all composure speaking to natives — <em lang="it" class="about-emoji" data-emoji="🤌">che peccato!</em> I took Japanese in high school, but didn't apply myself, so I'm not good at it, but DuoLingo is <del>trying</del> <ins>threatening</ins> to help. Anyways, I find languages fascinating!
</p>

<h2 id="profesh-a-f-">Profesh A.F.</h2>

<p>
    I am a professional, as proven by the fact I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskirknielsen/">LinkedIn profile</a> that I ignore. I can write in <em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL</em>; I favour the <strong>Jamstack</strong> for static sites, like Eleventy or Hugo, but I'm equally comfortable with a <strong>WordPress</strong> setup, neatly tracked in a repository. You'll also find that the <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong> is dear to me; my usual suspects are Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. Oh, and I'm a French/Danish dual-citizen, and a US &quot;Green Card&quot; holder (yay paperwork: K-1 Visa to get married to my wife Ilona, then years of waiting for permanent recidency…).
