## Developer stuff

While front-end development is my focus nowadays, I grew up thinking I'd be a designer after playing with Microsoft Paint and then Photoshop (with a *totally* valid licence). I did dabble in code on MySpace and eventually making my own site (I even paid for a domain and hosting) and calling myself a **"webmaster"** before I even had zits on my face (the hubris). I ended up **studying graphic design for 4 years** then freelanced for some neat clients on video editing, ad banners, and "immersive" pages. Writing code and having a thing show up on the screen felt (and still feels) a little like <em class="about-emoji" data-emoji="✨">magic</em>, so I pursued that. Currently, I work at MOJO PSG as a senior front-end dev with a wonderful team, trying to make **accessible and performant** web pages, and learning new things in this constantly evolving field while having fun with CSS.

I have contributed to a few open source projects, but only in small ways; if it counts, this little VS Code extension of mine called [VisuBezier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chriskirknielsen.visubezier) to preview CSS easings is great, in my unbiased and trustworthy opinion. And I've been lucky enough to be featured on sites like [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriskirknielsen/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/chriskirknielsen/), if you can believe it!

## Creative stuff

When I'm not doing client work, **I like to create designs** that might look good on a t-shirt — still getting those creative juices flowing! You can check all those out in the [Designs "Shop"](/designs/) if you're interested; it's got lots of dev-related designs, and a few <em class="about-emoji" data-emoji="🌴">'80s aesthetics</em> (my favourite!). I also geek out on video games from time to time and enjoy movies, so if you want to make my day, a movie quote might work (or puns — *I really love puns*). You might like to know that [I've created some typefaces](/fonts/) — I consider myself a font nerd and will (try to) recognise the font used for every logo until my last breath.

I am also a music enthusiast! I listen to a lot of things, however rock- and electronica-oriented styles provide most of my auditory relaxation. I have a project called [Chronoise](https://chronoise.com) for my mediocre musical musings that I haven't actively worked on in years but it sounds neat to say you write music. I need to get back into that because *synthesisers are incredibly fun*. Plus, my guitar skills are lacking, computers help me feel competent!

## Personal stuff

I mostly grew up in Lyon, France, to Danish parents. I did spend a year in Australia as a kid, speaking English with an Aussie accent, and even held a baby koala. As a result, **three languages** keep overriding each other; it's not confusing at all. I do know a decent amount of Italian but lose all composure speaking to natives — <em lang="it" class="about-emoji" data-emoji="🤌">che peccato!</em> I studied Japanese in high-school, at peak slacking-off mentality, so I'm not good at it, but DuoLingo is ~~trying~~ threatening to help. Additionally, while I understand about one in a hundred words (if that), I can read the Cyrillic alphabet. Not very useful, but it's made me dislike abusing non-Latin alphabets to write things. Anyways, I like languages! And my accent is weird!

## Professional stuff

I am a professional, as proven by the fact I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskirknielsen/) that I ignore. I can *program in HTML, CSS,* JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I favour the **Jamstack** for static sites, like Eleventy or Hugo, but I'm equally comfortable with a **WordPress** setup, all versioned in repositories. You'll also find that the **Adobe Creative Suite** is dear to me; my usual suspects are Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. Oh, and I'm a French/Danish dual-citizen, and a US "Green Card" holder.
